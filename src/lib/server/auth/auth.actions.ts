// This file is being deprecated and split into session.actions.ts and user.actions.ts
// to resolve the edge runtime issue with middleware.
// For now, we will leave it empty to avoid breaking existing imports until they are all updated.
// In a real scenario, this file would be deleted after refactoring.
