# **App Name**: Backend Boilerplate Generator

## Core Features:

- Backend Specification Input: User inputs specifications for backend (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.) and framework (Express, Django, Flask, etc.).
- Choose Boilerplate Modules: Allow users to choose if their backend should include things like authentication and database connectivity
- Backend Code Generation: Generative AI tool synthesizes backend code, using selected specifications and boilerplate modules to assemble code. It may make intelligent assumptions to include certain dependencies or helper functions, and comments on decisions it made. This tool reasons about the best approach for the current stack of user-selected settings, and adjusts its behavior based on the complete list.
- Generated Code Display: Display code with syntax highlighting. User can then review, download, and copy.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5), associated with intelligence and innovation.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), near white, providing a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#7CB342) to highlight key elements and calls to action, clearly differentiated from the primary.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. Space Grotesk brings a technical feel, while Inter offers excellent readability for extended text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying generated backend code snippets, ensuring clarity and readability.
- Icons should be simple and outline-based, in the accent color, ensuring they stand out without being distracting.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to enhance user experience and provide feedback during code generation.
